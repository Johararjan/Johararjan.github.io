        <h2>The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling, 1894</h2>
        <img src="bookCover/3.png"  class="books">
        <P> The Jungle Book is far less whimsical (and musical) than Disney's classic animated film,
            and it includes stories with different central characters besides Mowgli, the "mancub" raised by wolves
             and befriended by Baloo the bear. However, in part because of the charming movie, Mowgli's stories
             are probably the best loved and best known pieces in the collection. These wonderful stories, which
             alternate with lyrical poems about the characters, depict a complex and sometimes dangerous natural
              world in which creatures must respect the "ways of the jungle" in order to coexist. Creatures hunt
               and kill each other in suspenseful scenes, but almost all violent acts happen "offscreen." </P>
               <p>In one scene, Mowgli uses his wits to trick an adversary into being killed by a stampeding herd of cattle;
                 the animal's death is not shown, but Mowgli is later described skinning the animal. In general,
                 animals talk about killing others for food. The Jungle Book has been made into a number of film and TV
                  versions, and a sequel to the book, The Second Jungle Book, contains more stories about Mowgli and
                  other jungle creatures.
