        <P> What if someday you come to know that you own a property worth billions but that is in the possession of your relative?
            You will certainly rush to claim it and enjoy a luxurious life but remember my friend, claiming your right may cost you your
            life.
            Something similar happened with David Balfour after he turned an orphan. He was thrilled unaware of the fact that this will put
            him in a life threatening situation. What is his ultimate fate lies in this amazing novel named, Kidnapped.</P>
           <p>Kidnapped is one of the famous works of Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson which was originally
            published in 1886. It is a historic adventure and speculative fiction work which was written as a
            boys novel and was published in the Young Folks magazines.
            It was followed by the Catriona (1893) and was adapted to premiere for several years on the big screen from 1917 to 2005.
            A comic version was also published by Marvel Illustrated in 2007-2008. It was believed that the novel was based on the
            James Annesley Case  who was kidnapped by his own uncle at the age of 12.
