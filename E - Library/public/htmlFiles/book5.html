        <h2>Tarzan of the Apes Edgar Rice Burroughs, 1914</h2>
        <img src="bookCover/5.png"  class="books">
        <P> Tarzan of the Apes, the 1912 book by Edgar Rice Burroughs that launched a pop-cultural empire,
            is a thrilling page-turner with a minefield on nearly every one of its 400 pages. Murder and mayhem abound,
            as humans and animals kill each other, as well as members of their own species, with gusto. And there are cannibals.
             Tarzan himself is fond of snaring members of a jungle tribe with a noose, strangling them, and dropping their bodies
              from treetops vengeful soldiers wipe out a village; seafaring scalawags hack and bludgeon one another to death.
               There are also plentiful, outmoded stereotypes, especially regarding gender roles and race. There's more innuendo
                about primeval behavior than actual lurid detail in the Tarzan-Jane romance, which involves numerous rescues
                 but only one scene of intense kissing (it ends quickly and leads to much internal conflict.
