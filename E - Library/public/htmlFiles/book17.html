        There were eccentric characters in the hotel. The Paris slums are a gathering-place for eccentric people—people who have fallen
         into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent. Poverty frees them from ordinary standards of
         behaviour, just as money frees people from work. Some of the lodgers in our hotel lived lives that were curious beyond words.
         There were the Rougiers, for instance, an old, ragged, dwarfish couple who plied an extraordinary trade.
         They used to sell postcards on the Boulevard St Michel. The curious thing was that the postcards were sold in sealed packets as
         pornographic ones, but were actually photographs of chateaux on the Loire; the buyers did not discover this till too late, and of
          course never complained. The Rougiers earned about a hundred francs a week, and by strict economy managed to be always half starved
           and half drunk. The filth of their room was such that one could smell it on the floor below. According to Madame F., neither of the
           Rougiers had taken off their clothes for four years.
