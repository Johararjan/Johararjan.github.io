        It was at least certain that Phileas Fogg had not absented himself from London for many years.
         Those who were honoured by a better acquaintance with him than the rest, declared that nobody could pretend to have
          ever seen him anywhere else. His sole pastimes were reading the papers and playing whist. He often won at this game,
          which, as a silent one, harmonised with his nature; but his winnings never went into his purse, being reserved as a
