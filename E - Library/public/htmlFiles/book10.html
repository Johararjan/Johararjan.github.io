        <h2>Oliver Twist </h2>

        For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception.
        He was brought up by hand. The hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the
        workhouse authorities to the parish authorities. The parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities
         whether there was no female then domiciled in ‘the house’ who was in a situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and
         nourishment of which he stood in need. The workhouse authorities replied with humility, that there was not. Upon this, the parish
         authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be ‘farmed,’ or, in other words, that he should be dispatched
         to a branch-workhouse some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws, rolled about
         the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental superintendence of an
         elderly female, who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week.
         Sevenpence-halfpenny’s worth per week is a good round diet for a child; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny,
         quite enough to overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable. The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience;
         she knew what was good for children; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself. So, she appropriated
         the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance
         than was originally provided for them. Thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great
          experimental philosopher
