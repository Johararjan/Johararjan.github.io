        <h2>Crime and Punishment Fyodor Dostoevsky, 1866</h2>

        Raskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before, he avoided society of every sort,
        more especially of late. But now all at once he felt a desire to be with other people. Something new seemed to be taking place within
        him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. He was so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy
         excitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some other world, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness
          of the surroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern.
          The master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequently came down some steps into the main room,
           his jaunty, tarred boots with red turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his person. He wore
            a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat, with no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil
             like an iron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there was another boy somewhat younger who
              handed whatever was wanted. On the counter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and some fish,
               chopped up small, all smelling very bad. It was insufferably close, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five
                minutes in such an atmosphere might well make a man drunk.
