        <h2>A Tale of Two Cities Charles Dickens, 1859</h2>
        <img src="bookCover/4.png"  class="books">
        <P> A Tale of Two Cities, sets a riveting story of romantic and familial love against the violent drama of the French Revolution.
             The personal and the political are deeply connected, and complicated, and additional historical background regarding the
             French monarchy, feudal system, and French Revolution will help young readers appreciate the novel. It's also worth noting
              that though this is one of Dickens' best-loved works, it is atypical of the author in some ways. A Tale of Two Cities
               has fewer humorous, colorful characters than others of his most-read books (other than the Crunchers), and the plot is
               more grand and far-reaching.
