        <h2>The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde Robert Louis Stevenson, 1886</h2>

        MR. UTTERSON the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance, that was never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in'
         discourse; backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary, and yet somehow lovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to
          his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never found its way into his talk, but which spoke
           not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts of his life. He was austere with
           himself; drank gin when he was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had not crossed the doors
           of one for twenty years. But he had an approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high pressure
            of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove.
            ‘I incline to, Cain’s heresy,’ he used to say. ‘I let my brother go to the devil in his quaintly: ‘own way.’
            In this character, it was frequently his fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives
             of down-going men. And to such as these, so long as they came about his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his
              demeanour.
