        The shaft flew straight; the archer fell forward with a cry, and lay on his face upon the ground, his arrows rattling about him
        from out of his quiver, the gray goose shaft wet with his; heart’s blood. Then, before the others could gather their wits about
        them, Robin Hood was gone into the depths of the greenwood. Some started after him, but not with much heart, for each feared to
        suffer the death of his fellow; so presently they all came and lifted the dead man up and bore him away to Nottingham Town.
        Meanwhile Robin Hood ran through the greenwood. Gone was all the joy and brightness from everything, for his heart was sick within
         him, and it was borne in upon his soul that he had slain a man.
