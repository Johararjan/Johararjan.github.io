        ‘Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don’t
        tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that AntichristI really
         believe he is AntichristI will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my ‘faithful slave,’
          as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened yousit down and tell me all the news.’

    It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.
